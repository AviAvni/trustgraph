# TrustGraph API Overview

TrustGraph provides a suite of APIs to interact with its services,
including text analysis, entity relationship extraction, and large
language model interactions. Here's an overview of the key APIs we've
explored:

## `PromptClient`

Purpose: Sends text chunks to the TrustGraph Prompt service for
various analysis tasks.

Key Methods:

- `request_definitions`: Extracts definitions for entities in the text.

    Key Method:
        request: Sends a text prompt to the LLM and receives the generated text.

GraphRagClient

    Purpose: Sends retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) queries to a GraphRAG service to retrieve information from a knowledge graph.
    Key Method:
        request: Sends a RAG query and receives the generated response.

Overall, these APIs enable you to:

    Analyze text for entities, relationships, and topics.
    Generate text based on prompts and knowledge graphs.
